### Hi there ðŸ‘‹, Timishot
#### SOFTWARE ENGINEERING
Hey there, recruiters and developers! I'm Timilehin, a Nigerian software engineer with a passion for languages - both the spoken and the coding kind. HTML (the markup language, I know, I know ðŸ˜„), C, JavaScript, and Python are my go-to's, and developing responsive sites is my jam. Because let's be real, a site that's not responsive is like a clingy ex - it just won't let go.

But I digress. My love for coding languages and responsive design runs deep, and I'm always excited to collaborate with like-minded individuals. So if you're looking for a talented, fun-loving software engineer to join your team, look no further! Let's create something awesome together.

Skills: / HTML / CSS/JAVASCRIPT/C/PYTHON/SHELL
